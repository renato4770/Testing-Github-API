# Testing-Github-API
I created a Github API testing where I pull the best starred python repositories

# Best Github starred Python repositories

This is made by the Github API where I pull all python repositories

I've added the HTML file, and the .py file

If you want to generate this chart with other most popular languages on Github just change the URL call on the API

C example :
 Make an API call and store the response.

url ='https://api.github.com/search/repositories?q=language:c&sort=stars'

JavaScript:

 Make an API call and store the response.

url ='https://api.github.com/search/repositories?q=language:javascript&sort=stars'
